# Atari-Basic-Computer-Games
Atari BASIC conversion of David Ahl's classic [Basic Computer Games](https://archive.org/details/Basic_Computer_Games_Microcomputer_Edition_1978_Creative_Computing). The book content is also available at [Atari Archives](http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/) and some interesting discussion is at the [DigiBarn Online Museum](https://digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/).

Original source code download from [http://vintage-basic.net/games.html](http://vintage-basic.net/games.html)

## Conversion Considerations
I'll try to keep track of how I make changes.
